# User Localization in 5G Networks Using Machine Learning

Welcome to the User Localization in 5G Networks project! This repository explores the use of machine learning techniques to enable precise user localization in 5G networks using Beamformed Fingerprints (BFFs). The project addresses the challenges of signal attenuation, multipath propagation, and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications.

## üìñ Project Overview

With the advent of **5G networks** leveraging **mmWave technology**, there are unique challenges in signal propagation, especially in urban environments. The proposed solution involves **Beamformed Fingerprints (BFFs)** and advanced deep learning techniques to achieve accurate localization in both line-of-sight (LOS) and NLOS scenarios. The key features include:

- **Accurate Positioning**: Achieves high accuracy even in NLOS conditions.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Significantly reduces energy requirements compared to traditional methods.
- **Advanced Deep Learning Models**: Employs CNNs, HCNNs, and sequence-based models for localization.
